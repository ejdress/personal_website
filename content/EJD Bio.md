I am a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley studying mechanical properties of knitted fabrics, combining tabletop experiments with theoretical models and simulations. My PhD research, advised by Prof. Joel Moore at UC Berkeley, focused on novel physics in topological insulators and quantum phase transitions. I completed my dissertation *Localization in quantum and classical disordered systems* in August 2023. I am excited to apply techniques and ideas from my doctoral research to a career in soft matter physics.

I am also passionate about teaching and scientific outreach.  I have been a teaching assistant for 5 semesters and have taught outreach courses on wind power and the physics of music.  An exciting outreach project I'm currently working on is the design of science-inspired knitting patterns.

Outside of physics and knitting (and now machine knitting!), I enjoy swimming, cooking, playing violin with friends, and hiking.
